# Number to LCD

Goal: write a program that displays LCD style numbers.

### Part 1

Write a program that given a number (with arbitrary number of digits), converts it into LCD style numbers using the following format:

```
   _  _     _  _  _  _  _  
 | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|  
 ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _|  
```
 
(each digit is 3 lines high)

Note: Please do *NOT* read the second part before completing the first. Part of the purpose of this kata is to make you  practice refactoring and adapting to changing requirements. [Part two is here](part2.md)
